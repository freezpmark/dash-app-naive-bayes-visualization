### Interactive tutorials in machine learning (2018) - Abstract of Bachelor's Thesis:
The aim of the bachelor thesis is to provide basic overview of machine learning and its used
approaches. The greatest emphasis will be placed upon classification methods, in which will be
used two different algorithms focusing on the text data in particular. The main task will be to
explain the processes of these algorithms to users in the simplest way possible through executable
document and interactive web application. Executable document will provide an interactive
programming environment in which practical tasks are solved with accompanying text and helpful
visualizations. The greatest attention will be paid to the Naive Bayesian classifier, along with
providing extensive interactive visualizations to allow deep tracking of its computational processes
through web application. By using interaction elements, we will be able to experiment with
different algorithm configurations and observe relationships between data samples and its attributes
via graphs.
